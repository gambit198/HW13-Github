# HW13-Github
HW13 for Bootcamp

This intro is to better explain what we were taught over the period of this bootcamp.

It is to show the work and skills we praticed during the various topics we covered.

In the "ansible" folder I included the scripts that were used to install, and configure our ansible container.

In the "diagram" folder, I included the network diagram, and the Elk stack diagram which coincided with the ansible project.

In the "linux" folder, I included the bash scripts we used for 2 projects earlier in the course when the class first touched the linux section of the bootcamp.
